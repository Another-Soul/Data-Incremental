# Data Incremental
Data Incremental is a game about storing data and mastering more advanced technologies as you ascend the order of magnitudes!

This game works from LÖVE, so you'll have to install LÖVE from [this link](https://love2d.org/), download Data Incremental's source code (Preferrably ZIP), and drag the folder "Data Incremental" onto love.exe files (which should be in C:/Program Files)
Data Incremental supports only 600x800 resolution right now, 1600x900 coming soon!
